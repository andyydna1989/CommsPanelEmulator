# CommsPanelEmulator
A WIP voice system emulator for training staff.

One of the few workplace tasks I can share publicly, this is a training emulator of a system used in one of our facilities. This app is intended to give them a primer on its use to ease the burden at the frontline unit.

Whilst a fairly simple app, it does show off the fundamentals and gave my DOM manipulation a bit of a work-out.
